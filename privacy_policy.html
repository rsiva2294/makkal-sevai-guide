<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: July 2025</p>

<p>
    <strong>Makkal Sevai Guide</strong> ("we", "our", or "the app") is an unofficial mobile application
    created to help the people of Tamil Nadu easily access and understand services under the
    "Ungaludan Stalin" scheme.
</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
    This app does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit</strong> any personal information from users.
    It operates completely <strong>offline</strong> and does not connect to any servers or third-party APIs.
</p>

<h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
<p>
    The app may request minimal permissions (like clipboard access) for features such as copying service information.
    These are only used locally on your device and not sent anywhere.
</p>

<h2>3. Internet Usage</h2>
<p>
    All core features are available offline. However, if you choose to access the live camp schedule,
    the app may open a link to the official government website in your browser.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
    We do not integrate any third-party analytics, ads, or external SDKs. All content is preloaded from the
    <a href="https://ungaludanstalin.tn.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        official Ungaludan Stalin website</a> and stored within the app for offline use.
</p>

<h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.
</p>

<h2>6. Contact</h2>
<p>
    If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy,
    please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@makkalsevaiguide.in">support@makkalsevaiguide.in</a>.
</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
    This is an <strong>unofficial app</strong> not affiliated with or endorsed by the Government of Tamil Nadu.
    All service information was sourced from the official Ungaludan Stalin website as of July 2025
    and is intended purely for informational and educational purposes.
