Privacy Policy
Last updated: July 18, 2025

Makkal Sevai Guide ("we", "our", or "the app") is an unofficial mobile application created to help the people of Tamil Nadu easily access and understand services under the "Ungaludan Stalin" scheme.

1. Data Collection & Use
We are committed to protecting your privacy. This app collects minimal, anonymized data to improve its functionality and stability, but does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) that could directly identify you.

Automatically Collected Information (Anonymous):
To understand app usage and address issues, we utilize Google Firebase services for:

Firebase Analytics: Collects anonymous usage data such as app opens, screen views, interactions with features (e.g., language switches, theme changes, search queries, brochure views, external link clicks), and device type. This data helps us understand popular features and areas for improvement. This collection is enabled only in release (production) builds and disabled in debug builds.

Firebase Crashlytics: Automatically collects crash reports and non-fatal errors that occur within the app. This data is entirely anonymous and essential for us to identify and fix bugs, improving app stability.

No Personal Information: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, location data, or any other personal identifiers.

2. Information Storage
The core service information (eligibility, documents) is primarily fetched dynamically from Google Firebase Storage when you have an internet connection, ensuring you get the latest updates. If you are offline, the app seamlessly falls back to using the data bundled within the app. No user-entered data or personal information is stored on our servers.

3. Permissions Used
The app may request minimal permissions necessary for its functionality:

Internet Access: Required to fetch the latest service data and brochure overviews from Firebase Storage, and to open external links (like the official camp schedule or developer profile) in your browser.

Clipboard Access: For features like copying service information to your clipboard.
These permissions are used solely for the stated purposes within the app's functionality and are not exploited for any other reason.

4. External Links
The app includes direct links to external websites, such as the official "Ungaludan Stalin" camp schedule page, developer profiles, or app store review pages. When you click these links, you will be directed to an external browser or app, and our Privacy Policy no longer applies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external sites or services you visit.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

Disclaimer
This is an unofficial, fan-made application created to help citizens. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to the Government of Tamil Nadu or any government entity. All service information and brochure content has been sourced from the official "Ungaludan Stalin" public website as of July 18, 2025, and is intended purely for informational purposes. While we strive for accuracy, users are strongly encouraged to verify details with official government sources before making any decisions based on the information provided in this app.
